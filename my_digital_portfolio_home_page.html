            <div id= "personal">
                <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Gifford. I have created this website to present to users and possible employers, my skills and knowledge that I have gained whilst studying Computing at Gloucestershire College.I first learnt to code in Visual Basic and much later learnt the principles of Object Orientated Programming with Java. I then progressed onto web design and learnt HTML4 and later HTML5 with CSS3. I have also gained knowledge in Project Management, Computer Systems, Networking and Virtulisation. I am currently at the University of Gloucestershire, studying for a degree in Forensic Computing.</p>  
                <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
                <p>When I'm not studying for a qualification, I like to read detective novels and play video games. I also like to play Pool and watch television occasionally. When working towards a project or about to start a course, I try and stay ahead of things by studying extra material.</p>
