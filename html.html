		<h2>HTML</h2>
		<p>I first learnt HTML4 with CSS3 during 2010, when I was studying for a Level 2 BTEC First Diploma ICT Practitioner at Gloucestershire College. I then continued developing my knowledge of HTML by learning HTML5 whilst studying a Level 4 BTEC HNC Diploma in Computing and Systems Development. My confidence in writing HTML5, grew whilst working on a project, which went towards course work for a level 5 HND in Computing and Systems development nonetheless, click on the <a href="project_management.html">Project Management</a> link to visit the page.<br>Below I will explain, a little in depth about the website's that I had to build.</p>

			<h3>HTML4</h3>
			<p>During my level two qualification, I was given a task to build a Tourism website based around locations in Gloucestershire. I picked 4 locations to focus each page on, these were;Gloucestershire Cathedral, Gloucester Docks, Cheltenham Town hall and Pitville Pump Rooms.<br>These locations were interesting because from the perspective of a student, I learnt about the history of each building/area and provided users who visited my site, information on each. Furthermore, all of the images that were present on the website were of my own.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="html_five">
			<h3>HTML5</h3>
			<p>During my level four qualification, I studied a unit called Website Design, where I learnt about the design theory and methodology. From studying this unit, I was introduced to Persona documents which give an overview of a basic user who might visit the site nonetheless, from this I was able to work out the users goals and needs and build a design around them. For further ideas I also had to carry out a competitor analysis which looked at similar websites for inspiration of layout and content. This all went towards a deliverable that I had to build for an assignment which was a website which promoted a fake Cheltenham Folk Music Festival.</p>
