<h2>Fireworks Display</h2>
<p>We was originally given a budget of £500 and a deadline of 7th of November to output a deliverable, in this case a fireworks display but after a few hours the deadline was changed to 11th of November and after about 3 weeks the budget was increased to £600 to account for the outsourcing fee and hiring of Sandling fireworks to manage the display.</p>
<p>During the first week, we had intentions of purchasing fireworks and with being curious, I carried out some research on the legislation of storing explosives by looking into MSER 2005 or The Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations Act 2005 and we concluded that hiring Sandling fireworks was the better option as they provided a professional display.</p>
<h3>Permissions, Risks and Advertisements</h3>
<p>We also had to get permission from the Llanthony Secunda Priory Trust to use their land and we arrived at a decision that it would be best practise to alert the Gloucester fire department. A health and safety Officer from the fire department also provided us with a risk assessment which we had to complete and return. The risk assessment provided us a way of logically working out the severity of the risks and the solutions and precautions that we would put in place on the night.<br>To promote the event we got the College magazine interested in the event, where we as a team co-wrote an article that was then published a couple of weeks before the event. To further promote it, and draw people to the event, we designed posters both big and small and strategically placed them around the college. The event went off with a bang, and was a huge success.</p>
