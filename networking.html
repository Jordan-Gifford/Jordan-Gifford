	<h2>Networking</h2>
	<p>During my studies, I have learnt and gathered knowledge on Networking and <a href="active_directory.html">Active Directory</a>. For example I have learnt about and are aware of the different topologies, which are still in use and/or have been phased out. I have  I also have knowledge in the different types of cable and hardware that can be used within a network infrastructure. I am also aware of the wiring and connection standards when it comes to designing a network. I have also learnt about the theory of subnetting from gaining the qualification known as 'CCNA Part 1'. This gave me the tools and in depth knowledge to understand how a network big or small operates and the means of how to design a network.</p>
	<h3>Tools and further experience</h3>
	<p>Through CCNA, it introduced me to use Packet Tracer, where I took the theory that I learnt and put into a practical use. Also through a combination of CCNA and Packet Tracer, I learnt about routing commands and got confident in programming a router through Packet Tracer. For example I learnt how to configure the ports and more importantly change the default password to something more unique and include a banner of the day.<br>I also have experience in using a couple of pieces of software that can be used to monitor the bandwidth and the nodes on a network.For instance, I have used <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and <a href="http://www.komodolabs.com/network-inventory/" target="_blank">Komodo Newt</a>.
