		<h2>Project Management</h2>
		<p>I first studied about Project Management during my Level 4 qualification. I learnt about the Project Management methodology and theoretically put the method into practise during my level 4 and 5 qualifications by forming a team. I found the methodology really fun to follow, as each section is a long drawn out process with a lot of barriers to get through to actually arrive at a deliverable.</p>

		<h3>Fireworks Display</h3>
		<p>After several months of planning and research, with a series of meetings between me and my team, with the staff of Gloucestershire College and Sandling Fireworks, we agreed to the date of 11th of November 2013. To promote the event we got the College magazine interested in the event, where we as a team co-wrote an article, that was then published a couple of weeks before the event. To further promote it, and draw people to the event, we designed posters both big and small and strategically placed them around the college. The event went off with a bang, and was a huge success.</p>
		<h3>Trip Management Database</h3>
		<p>As a team, we was tasked by the computing department of Gloucestershire College, to build a Trip Management Database with a web front end. Fortunately, the applications that we ended up using, I was aware of and had used during my studies for E-Commerce which went towards my HNC. We ended up using Xampp which included the use of their services of Apache and MySQL, which when combined creates a theoretical web server, which as a team we could all access and modify, once properly configured. From this project, my ability and confidence in writing HTML5 with CSS3 improved. Furthermore, it was from this project, where I learnt a couple of functions to call the data from the database and with fornatting the CSS, present it on the web page in a simple layout.</p>
