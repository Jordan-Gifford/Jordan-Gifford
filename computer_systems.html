	<h2>Computer Systems</h2>
	<p>Throughout studying computing I have gained knowledge in using Windows 7 and most recently using Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu. Growing up, I also used Windows 95, Windows 98 and XP and experimented with Windows 3.1 through Virtulisation. </p>
	<h3>Knowledge of hardware</h3>
	<p>From studying at Gloucestershire College, I have gained some basic knowledge in hardware and improved on it through studying Virtulisation. Whilst I was studying for a HNC in Computing, I gained the skill of building a Computer System from scratch. Furthermore, during my HND, I carried out an upgrade on my laptop, upgrading the hard drive from a 500GB to a 1TB drive. From setting myself a short term challenge, I decided to upgrade my Personal Computer, by doing so I was able to improve the memory amount and capacity, the processing power and by purchasing a new motherboard, I have room for the option of expanding the memory capacity and amount at a later date. Since studying at the University of Gloucestershire, I have improved my knowledge of hardware and have gained an understanding and skill in writing Unix commands. I have also gained a skill in working out Binary to Hexadecimal conversions.</p>
