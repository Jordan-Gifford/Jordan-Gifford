	<h2>Computer Systems</h2>
	<p>Throughout studying computing I have used a number of operating systems. Shockingly it has mostly been with windows. For instance growing up, I used windows 95, 98, XP, 3.1 Windows 7 and most recently Windows 10. From studying Computing at Gloucestershire College, I also had gained experience in using the Windows Server 2008 R2 Operating System and with continuing my studies at the University of Gloucestershire, I have some experience in using Linux Ubuntu where I have been experimenting with Unix commands.</p>
	<h3>Knowledge of hardware</h3>
	<p>During my studies, I have gained some basic knowledge in hardware and improved on it through studying Virtualisation. I have also gained the skill of building a Computer System from scratch and when required have solved problems in some cases with hardware and software. Furthermore, I carried out some upgrades on my own personal equipment both big and small. Since studying at the University of Gloucestershire, I am slowly improving my knowledge of hardware. I have also gained a skill in working out Binary to Hexadecimal conversions,vice versa and Decimal to Binary Coded Decimal Numbers in addition, I have also recently learnt about the Ascii conversions into binary into decimal and vice versa.</p>
