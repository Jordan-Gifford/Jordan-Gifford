	<h2>Independent Projects</h2>
	<p>During my HNC, I studied a module titled 'Database Design Concepts', which allowed me to learn in some depth about the Database Design methodologies and the theory of carrying out Normalisation and constructing an Entity Relationship Diagram or ERD. The module allowed me to customise one of the assignments and more importantly give me the experience of working with a client independently to produce a Database solution for their business. The experience taught me to be patient with the client and really think about the questions and if possible, to prepare the questions before seeing the client, in order get a better understanding of their current system and what they would like their database to output and record. Furthermore, from working independently with the client, I learnt the experience of the project scope (The database solution) and it's requirements were getting bigger as the client was requesting more features nevertheless, I was able to for fill the added requirements and the database solution was a success.</p>
	<h3>Website Project</h3>
	<p>A year later, I was asked by the same client, if I could build him a website exactly like he designed. He stated that where he created his website, he didn't have much control over the way it looked and mostly was having trouble updating the content. When analysing the website, I found it to be database driven, as for example one of his pages, was a Blog of the jobs that he had carried out each day and when examining each blog entry that took the user to another page. That blog in its simplest form is a table and theoretically could be outputted onto the webpage through PHP functions. I chose to use MySQL as the database for the back end and use the facilities of Twig to output the webpages. Unfortunately  I never got to finish the project as his company shut down.</p>
