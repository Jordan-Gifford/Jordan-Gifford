<h2>Java</h2>
<p>Through a combination of learning the principles of both Object Orientated Programming or OOP and the Java programming language, I was able to build a cinema system that a client and an administrator could use. For example, an administrator could add and remove a film or move and/or assign a screen to a particular showing. Whereas, a client could input a request to search for films that are current at the cinema, which in theory would bring up a list of films and their relevant information. The client could also book to see a film which would be a quite a long process.<br>Below are two images of the planning work that I produced for the cinema system.Both items were produced through Star UML.</p>
<a href="static/images/user_case_diagram.png" rel="lightbox" title="A user case diagram of the cinema system."><img style="padding-left:22%" src="static/images/user_case_diagram_resized.png" alt="language programme" /></a><!--Here is an example of an inline style or in this case inline formatting. I've simply applied a 22% padding to the images separately. Its better practise to keep styles and formatting within their separate or collated css file/s. Also within this nested anchor tag, I have applied some simple Java Script to the image to create a gallery effect. When a user clicks on the resized image it should present a bigger and centred  image with suitable descriptive text over a grey background/overlay.-->

<h3>Star UML</h3> 
<p>In working out what was part of the solution, I used an application known as 'Star UML'. While using Star UML, I put together a Use Case diagram to work out the function of the application, what kind of data would be stored and who likely would be using it. From producing the use case, I was able to build up a mental image of what steps the user would go through to, for example, book a ticket nevertheless, what I created was a User Journey document. In addition, I also used Star UML to produce the class model and work out the commands that would run within the application to manage the data and it's relevant functions.</p>
