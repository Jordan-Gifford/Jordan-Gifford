	<h3>Trip Management Database</h3>
	<p>As a team, we was tasked by the computing department of Gloucestershire College, to build a Trip Management Database with a web front end. Fortunately, the applications that we ended up using, I was aware of and had used during my studies for E-Commerce which went towards my HNC. We ended up using Xampp which included the use of their services of Apache and MySQL, which when combined creates a theoretical web server, which as a team we could all access and modify, once properly configured. From this project, my ability and confidence in writing HTML5 with CSS3 improved. Furthermore, it was from this project, where I learnt a couple of functions to call the data from the database and with fornatting the CSS, present it on the web page in a simple layout.</p>
