<h2>VB.Net</h2>
<p>I first learnt VB (Visual Basic) during 2009, when I studied for a level 2 BTEC First Diploma ICT Practitioner. When being taught about it, I found it easy to write and it was fun when thinking about the programmes that one could build and produce. When given examples to complete in class, they were very basic and simple applications, for example, I once had to build a calculator and a temperature converter. I then progressed onto more interesting applications that require password authentication when attempting to initiate the application or gain access. They were extremely fun to create as you could create some very amusing messages to the users. Below I will explain the features and functions of 2 applications that I built using VB.</p>

<div id="language_app">
<h3>Language Application</h3>
		<p>The first one is a basic application, where the user of a specific nationality, (English, Spanish, French, Italian and German) can type 'Hello' in their own language, and the programme outputs 'Hello World' in their own language.<p>

</div>
<div id="encryption_app">		
		<h3>Encryption Application</h3>
		<p>The second application allows a user when authenticated to encrypt a single text file or from text manually entered, into the left text box, using the ROT13 method. A piece of text that uses the same method of encryption, can also be decrypted with the result appearing in the bottom left text box.</p>
