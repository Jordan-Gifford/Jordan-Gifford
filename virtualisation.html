	<h2>Virtualisation</h2>
	<p>During my HND, I studied about the basics of Virtualisation. I learnt about the concept and of the different types of hypervisors used within Virtualisation. For example, a type one hypervisor operates on the hardware layer and requires a command prompt to configure the virtual machines but still does have a basic Operating System, which can be accessed vie an external monitor, in order to manage the memory and storage capacity between the hardware and the virtual machines and manage the security of the hypervisor. A good example of a type one hypervisor is Microsoft's Hyper V. Whereas, a type two hypervisor operates above the hardware and alongside the Operating System layer, a good example of one that I have and still use is Virtual box, as Virtual box can be installed and can run on any Operating System platform.</p>
	<h3>Using Virtual Box more and more...</h3>
	<p>I've used virtual box a couple of times over the years in education. For instance, I used it to have a look at windows 3.1 and then used it heavily during my HND, to learn about Virtual Machines and to implement Windows 7 and Windows Server 20008 R2 Operating System as Virtual Machines, where I learnt in some detail about and managed Active Directory. I have also used it recently to learn about the Linux Operating System and to practise Unix commands.</p>
