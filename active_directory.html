	<h2>Active Directory</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
	<p>During my HND, I studied a module titled 'Network Infrastructure', which allowed me to learn in quite a lot of depth about Active Directory. Theoretically I carried out some thorough research and arrived at a conclusion of how Active Directory works and manages its Users, Groups of users and their computers.</p>
	<h3>How did I do it?</h3>
	<p>By studying Virtulisation, it gave me the knowledge and decision to implement Active Directory through a Virtual Machine which ran Windows Server 2008 R2 edition.</p>
	<h3>What did I have to do?</h3>
	<p>At the time I was tasked with theoretically managing several departments who would have access to specific departmental drives and resources and also manage the access and rights towards users. To put it into practise, I created users and computers within department groups known as 'Organisational Units' and after some configuration, created and assigned shared network drives and the access rites to both, groups of users and individual users. Furthermore, I also learnt how to assign File and Disk Quotas to all users. To successfully test my set up and configuration of Active Directory against adding a computer to the domain and checking the rights of specific users, I created a secondary virtual machine, which acted as a client which ran Windows 7 and pointed the details (Computer Name and DNS address) to the Active Directory Server's Virtual Machine.</p>
